Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm that helps to classify data into different categories. It works by finding a line or a boundary (known as hyperplane) that best separates the different categories.

Imagine that you have two sets of points, each with a different color, scattered randomly on a graph. You want to find a line that separates the two sets of points as well as possible. This is what SVM does. It looks for the line that maximizes the margin between the two sets of points.

Once the line has been found, SVM uses it to classify new data points by checking which side of the line they fall on. If they fall on one side, they belong to one category, and if they fall on the other side, they belong to the other category.

SVM can also be used with more than two categories by using multiple lines to separate the different groups of data points.
